EXTENDED ABSTRACT 
The variety of energy sources which can be used to produce hydrogen makes hydrogen 
more and more attractive as an energy vector. A way  to transform renewable and other 
non-fossil sources of energy into hydrogen is water  electrolysis. 
The specific targeted research project “Highly Effi cient, High Temperature, Hydrogen 
Production by Water Electrolysis” (Hi 2H2) was launched in 2004 in the frame of the 
European Framework Program 6. The aim of the projec t was to demonstrate the 
feasibility of hydrogen production by high temperat ure water electrolysis using currently 
available Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) technology.  Coupled to renewable energy 
sources, this technology may meet the present envir onmental and economical requests. 
The Hi 2H2 project is a consortium of four European research l aboratories - EIFER 
(coordinator) and DLR in Germany, Risø DTU in Denma rk, and EMPA in Switzerland, 
bringing together skills and experience in the fiel d of material science, electrochemistry, 
and renewable energy.  
In order to determine the best operating conditions  of the Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells 
(SOEC) in the High Temperature Electrolysis (HTE) m ode, a number of experiments 
have been realized at different scales, from cells and single repeating units (SRU) to 
stack. Results obtained were then used to make the technical and economical analysis of 
the hydrogen production by high temperature water e lectrolysis.

Introduction 
The uniqueness of the concept is to perform water e lectrolysis at a high temperature, 
between 700 and 900°C. High temperature electrolysi s of steam (HTE) is expected to 
consume less electrical energy as compared to elect rolysis at low temperature as 
consequence of the more favourable thermodynamic an d electrochemical kinetic 
conditions for the reaction (Dutta, 1990).  
Experimental 
Two types of planar SOFC designs with up to 100 cm 2 active area were considered: an 
electrode (ceramic-metal compound) supported and a porous metal substrate supported 
Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cell (SOEC). Low cost indu strial manufacturing techniques 
(like screen printing and tape casting) are applied  to produce the advanced ceramic 
materials 
Performances of these SOECs were measured as a func tion of the operating temperature 
and the percentage of humidity of the inlet gas. As  expected, the performance of the cell 
becomes better with increasing the operating temper ature and the humidification level. 
High performances when achieved using electrode sup ported SOEC’s made at Risø  
DTU. So far, no SOECs have been reported to have be tter initial performance at similar 
operating conditions. A record-breaking performance  was reached at 950 °C, where 
steam electrolysis was operated at a current densit y of -3.6 A.cm -2 and a cell voltage of 
only 1.48 V (Jensen et  al, 2007) (Fig. 1). These current densities were o btained at high 
electrical efficiencies which would correspond to a  production rate of hydrogen of 1.34 
kg.m-2.h-1.

different temperatures and steam partial pressures in the inlet gas to the cell (Jensen et  
al, 2007). 
Durability tests of up to 2500 hours were performed  with single cells. Some tests 
demonstrated that a degradation below 2%/1000h can be achieved at current densities 
down to -0.5 A/cm 2, temperatures between 800 and 950°C, and a steam p ercentage of 
up to 70 vol.%.  
Cells were assembled with an interconnect plate to build a serial repeating unit (SRU). 
This SRU was sealed with a glass seal. Protective c oatings of the interconnect plates 
were developed and validated during the project. In  order to account to the corrosive 
operating conditions (high temperature and oxidizin g atmosphere). Durability tests of 
SRUs demonstrated that corrosion of the interconnec t plate can be slowed down by the 
M. Zahid, A. Brisse, A. Hauch, G. Schiller & U. Vog t  
use of protective coatings. However, in-situ impeda nce spectroscopy measurements 
revealed that the electrical conductivity of these coatings has to be further improved. 
An increase in the cell voltage was observed by Ris ø DTU during the first hundred 
hours of the durability test when a glass seal was used in the SRU. Thereafter the cell 
voltage decreased. The passivation/activation pheno menon was unambiguously 
attributed to a silica deposition, coming from the glass seal, at the interface between the 
electrolyte and the hydrogen electrode (Hauch et al , 2007). A sealing pre-treatment was 
developed to avoid the initial passivation/activati on process (Hauch et  al, 2008). 
The latest development consisted in the assembly of  two electrolyser stacks of 250 and 
600 cm 2 active areas. The first stack (250 cm 2 active area) was tested for more than 
3500h at 800°C and -0.3 A/cm². The average degradat ion rate during the first 2000 h 
was about 14 %/1000h (Fig. 2). After 2000 hours, th e steam content was increased, 
which improve the stack performance, and leaded to a lower degradation rate of 6 
%/1000h.

1 Nl/min H 2 + 0.5 Nl/min N 2 at the hydrogen electrode side, 7.5 Nl/min at the oxygen 
electrode side, and 50 vol.% of steam. After 2000 h , the N 2 flow was stopped and the 
steam content was increased to 70 vol.%. 
Based on the achieved results, a techno-economical analysis was made to predict the 
hydrogen production cost. A cost of around 2 €/kg was calculated assuming an average 
electricity price of 0.05 €/kWh, a cell operating voltage below the value of 
thermoneutral potential (1.3 V at 800°C) and a wate r vapour source at 200°C. The study 
also revealed that an increase in the temperature o f the water source would not decrease 
the hydrogen cost significantly because the main fa ctor influencing the hydrogen 
production cost is the electricity price. 
Conclusions 
Results obtained within the project have demonstrat ed that hydrogen can be produced 
through water electrolysis with higher efficiencies , greater than 90%. SOFC can be 
operated in the electrolysis mode with low operatio n voltages in the range of 1 to 1.3V. 
Cells are thus suitable for reversible operation. T he estimated hydrogen production cost 50 vol.% Steam 70 vol.% Steam

low temperature hydrogen production processes.
