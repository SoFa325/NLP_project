ABSTRACT:  
 
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) and High Temperat ure Electrolysis (HTE) work on two opposite 
processes. 
The basic equations (Nernst equation, corrected by a te rm of over-voltage) are thus very similar, only 
a few signs are different. An operational model, ba sed on measurable quantities, was finalized for HTE 
process, and adapted to SOFCs. The model is analytical, which requires some complementary 
assumptions (proportionality of over-tensions to th e current density, linearization of the logarithmic 
term in Nernst equation). It allows determining hydrogen production by HTE using a limited number of parameters.  
At a given temperature, only one macroscopic parame ter, related to over-voltages, is needed for 
adjusting the model to the experimental results (S OFC), in a wide range of hydrogen flow-rates. For a 
given cell, this parameter follows an Arrhenius law with a satisfactory precision. 
The prevision in HTE process is compared to the available experimental results.

Hydrogen consumption in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and hydrogen production by High Temperature Electrolysis (HTE) are two opposite processes: 
 
- SOFC: formation of water steam from hydrogen and oxygen, according to reaction (R1); the reaction 
is exothermic and spontaneous, it produces electrical and thermal energy. The irreversibilities 
decrease the available voltage at  the boundaries of the cell 
 - HTE: formation of hydrogen and oxygen from water, according to reaction (R2); the reaction is 
conversely endothermic and non spontaneous. Thus, it is necessary to supply electrical and 
thermal energy. The irreversibilities increase the electrical energy to be supplied to the electrolyzer. 
 
The behaviour of both reactors (electrolysis cell or fuel cell) is mainly based on Nernst equation, which 
correlates the Gibbs free energy ΔG and the electromotive force of a chemical system.  
 Applied to both reactions Nernst equation reads: 
 
SOFC:

2 gas + ½ O 2 gas Î H2Ovap  , HTE: 
(R2): H 2Ovap Î H2 gas + ½ O 2 gas

where E is the electromotive force (in V), E° the st andard electromotive force (in V) and P the pressure 
(in bar). E is correlated to the Gibbs free energy ΔG of reaction (R1) by 
F2ΔG(R1)E(R1)−= . Similarly, 
F2(R1)ΔG(R1)E°−=° .   
As reaction (R1) is spontaneous, ΔG(R1) < 0 and E(R1) >0. 
 
Considering that E(R2) = - E(R1), one can observe th at both equations (1) and (2) can be written on a 
unique manner, provided that the orientation of the in tensities in the main circuit are taken opposite.

where E° is taken positive in all cases. E° only depends on temperature. 
 However, Nernst equation is valid when no current crosses the electrolyte, i.e. no hydrogen is 
produced (HTE) or consumed (SOFC). As soon as a current circulates in the electrolyte, some 
irreversibilities occur. 3 types of over-voltages can be pointed out: 
 
- Ohmic over-voltage, due to the passage of current in resistive materials (anode, electrolyte, cathode) 
 
- Activation over-voltage, due to the formation of ac tivated complexes during partial semi-reactions at 
the electrodes, described by Volmer - Butler equation 
 
- Concentration over-voltage, due to the fact that the real concentrations to be used in Nernst equation 
are concentrations at the interface electrode - el ectrolyte, and the measured concentrations are 
bulk concentrations.  
The last type of over-voltage is a mathematical ar tefact, the first two ones are real over-voltages, 
producing a local waste power by Joule effect.  
We aim to develop an operational model, i.e. a model only based on macroscopic quantities.  
 
A complementary notation: 
 On the hydrogen side, it may be noticed that one mole of hydrogen replaces (or is replaced by) exactly 
one mole of water. Hence, the pressure is const ant along the course of the gases. We introduce ξ, 
which is the transformation rate of H
2 into H 2O (or opposite), and we get: 
 
- in the case of HTE : ξP P
2H°=   and ξ) P PO2H−°= 1(  
- in the case of SOFC: ξ) P P
2H−°= 1(  and ξP PO2H°=  
 
where P° is the initial pressure init
O2Hinit
2HP P P +=°  
inξ and outξ  are respectively the transformation rates at the inlet and at the outlet of the cell. 
 
Experimental conditions   
The characteristics of the cell are:  
- Electrolyte thickness:  140 µm      Electrolyte material: zirconia doped with yttrium oxide (3% w/w) 
- Anode thickness:  40 µm       Anode material: gadolinium-doped ceria 
- Cathode thickness:  60 µm      Cathode material: strontium-doped lanthanum manganate - Active area:   70 or 98,5 cm²  
 
The cell is supplied with 300 ml.min-1 of N 2 (anodic side) and 2,6 l.min-1 of air (cathodic side). The 
heating ramp is 30°C.h-1. The anode is reduced at 700 °C, by the progressive introduction of H 2. Then 
the cell is heated to the operating temperature under H2. 
 
The shape of the device used in experiments is a di sc; the inlet of the gas is supposed to be punctual 
at the centre of the disc; the outlet is at the external edge of the cell.  
 
The inlet gas is water steam in HTE (or a mixture H 2O - H 2), pure hydrogen (or a mixture H 2O - H 2) in a 
SOFC. As the reactions (R1) or (R2) proceed on the whole surface of the cell, the transformation rate  
is a function of location, i.e.  ξ(r)ξ= , where r is the distance from the centre of the cell to the current 
point.  
 
SOFC model 
 In order to get an analytical model, some simplifications were carried out:  
- Over-voltages are proportional to the current 
density. The proportionality factor is called Area Surface Resistance (ASR). It is noted Rs 
(in 
Ω.m-2) 
- Oxygen pressure 
2OP is supposed to be 
constant throughout the cell 
 
- The logarithmic term in Nernst equation is replaced by a linear approximation, valid 
between ~0.125 and ~0.875 (Figure 1). We can 
write

The shape of the device used in experiments is a di sc; the inlet of the gas is supposed to be punctual

The results are gathered in the next figure (Fig. 2) . The voltage (in mV) obtained at the boundaries of 
the cell is plotted versus the intensity (in A) crossing the cell.  
3 experiments are presented. Only one parameter is adj usted (the ASR, Rs in the previous equations - 
all other parameters are known). As expected, the mo del fits correctly the linear part of the curves.  
In particular, the model correctly represents the variat ion of the global cell resistance as a function of 
the useful flow-rate. 
Some discrepancies are obtained at low intensity; th ey can be overcome by a best fit of the logarithmic 
expression (see Fig. 1 for instance).

An Arrhenius law can be fitted to the experiment al results. For the tested cell, one obtains 
T8538

The previous expression depends on the tested cell. Rs can be split into 3 terms, as noticed 
previously: 
 - an Ohmic contribution, which can be estimated, knowing the materials (t hickness and conductivity 
versus temperature) 
 - an activation contribution, which could be estimated provided that the parameters of Butler - Volmer 
equation (i.e. exchange current density) are known, 
 
- a concentration contribution, which could be es timated provided that diffusion coefficients in the 
various materials are known (a diffusion process is expected in the porous anode and cathode).   
Some complementary experiments are needed for a be tter estimation of the two last contributions. 
 
HTE model

- the logarithmic term is

voltage (it is a direct consequence of t he second Principle of Thermodynamics).

Equations (13) and (15) are exactly identical to equations (7) and (9), equation (14) differs from 
equation (8) by the signs before A and B. 
 
Validation of the equations (HTE)  
 The electric supplying is connected and the electrochemical behaviour of the cell is studied under 
different flow-rates or working potential. In fact this working potential determines the mode at which the 
electrolysis cell operates. There are 3 means of op erating high temperature electrolysis: endothermic, 
thermoneutral and exothermic operation: 
- At the cell voltage of 1.3 V (corresponding to the ∆H/2F of the reaction of water dissociation), the 
electrolysis generate enough heat to compensate en dothermic losses. The process is thermoneutral. 
- Above 1.3 V, excess heat is available to heat the steam at the electrolysis module inlet up to the 
operating temperature in a heat exchanger.  
- Below the thermoneutral voltage, a high temperature high temperature heat is needed. This can lead 
to an increase in the overall efficiency, but also to an increase of the investm ent costs for the process. 
 
The model, described by equations (13) to (15) was applied to HTE experiments, using a "zero 
parameter approach" (i.e. the value of Rs given by equation (9) was used without any correction). The results are plotted in the Figure 4 (experiments at 900°C for various initial compositions of the inlet 
gas) and Figure 5 (experiments at 800 and 900°C, for 2 flow-rates).

The fit is rather good, although no correction was performed. The main difference between SOFC and 
HTE is the deviation to linearity, which occurs for lower intensities in HTE than in SOFC.  This difference could be due to concentration over -voltage, as hydrogen and water steam have not the 
same diffusion coefficient through the electrode material. However, complementary experiments have 
to be carried out in specific conditions.   
 
  
 
Comparisons 
 
For a same temperature (900°C), the Figure 6 com pares the experimental and modelling results in 
SOFC and HTE. A same cell points out the same features of total resistance, in SOFC as well as in 
HTE conditions.

 The Ohmic contribution is obviously symmetric. One c an demonstrate that the activation contribution is 
symmetric too. The only discrepancy could come from the concentration contribution, which is 
dissymmetrical. In an improved model, these data c ould give an order of magnitude of the diffusion 
coefficients of water and hydrogen through the material of electrode.  
 
Hydrogen production 
 HTE experiments carried out at 900°C with a gaseous mixture 90% H
2O - 10% H 2 lead to the 
production of 230.5 NmL.min-1 H2, i.e. 2.34 NmL.min-1.cm-2, at a slightly exothermic working point 
(1.32 V). Consumption rate was 70% water. This result is comparable to those obtained by Dornier [1] 
in the frame of the Project HOTELLY in the 80's. For a slightly exothermal process, the produced 
hydrogen flow rate was 2.56 NmL.min-1.cm-2, at 1000°C in a tubular geometry. 
The decrease of H 2 percentage in the inlet mixture leads to an increase of H 2 production (2.47 
NmL.min-1.cm-2, at 1.32 V for an initial mixture 95 / 5). This is in agreement with the operational model, 
and Nernst equation. 
The temperature decrease leads to a very high in crease of the cell resistance. As a consequence, 
hydrogen production sharply decreases (1.40 NmL.min-1.cm-2, at 800°C).  
 
Conclusions 
 A simple model describing the behaviour of a solid oxide fuel cell as well as of a high-temperature 
electrolyser was finalised.  The model is analytical  (i.e. simplified), but a reasonably good agreement is 
found on validation against SOFC experiments, at least on the linear part of the curve voltage vs. 
intensity. This operational model is based on the fi t of only one parameter, the global resistance of the 
cell. This value is the sum of three contributions:  
- an Ohmic contribution, due to the electric re sistance of the current through the cell;  
- an activation contribution, due to the existence of activated complexes at the interface electrode / 
electrolyte, which is the site of t he half-reactions of oxido-reduction;  
- a "concentration" contribution, due to the difference in gas concentrations in the bulk (where they are 
measured, or calculated), and at the interface electrode / electrolyte, where Nernst local equation 
really applies.  A same resistance can characterize a cell functioning in SOFC or in HTE. However, a slight 
discrepancy appears in HTE processing at high intensities, thus at high voltages. It could be due to the 
concentration contribution to the global resistance of  the cell, which is dissy mmetric. More experiments 
are needed in order to improve this model.
