      <td>4.2 AREVA NP study  The whole interest of the auto-thermal mode is to allow superheating of the steam up to 500°C with the gas produced by the electrolyser. The external heat (via steam produced by a HTR or PWR reactor) can thus be supplied at temperatures lower than 200 °C and can be used to evaporate the water into steam to be dissociated in the electrolyser. The thermodynamic study of the cycle has allowed validating the hypothesis of operation in the auto-thermal mode. Optimisation of the sets of heat exchangers ( ∆Ts and heat transfer areas) has lead to the general scheme in figure 7. Results of the study of the different modes of operation of the electrolysers are summarized in the following table :                                                              Mode of operation                                   Auto-thermal Thermo-neutral Endo-thermal Extraction points on         One : High pressure           Two    :    High    pressure, Two : High pressure, the steam cycle                                            low pressure                  low pressure Electric power requi-                261 MWe                       257 MWe                       253 MWe red for the HTE Thermal power                       53.7 MWth                     53.7 MWth                     53.7 MWth required for the HTE                                              + 5.3 MWth                  + 10.57 MWth HTR net electric                  ~ 271.5 MWe                   ~ 268.75 MWe                  ~ 266.9 MWe output HTR plant electric                    45.25 %                       44.79 %                       44.45 % efficiency1 Hydrogen plant                        41,60 %                       41,83 %                       42,16 % global efficiency2   5. ASSESSMENT OF HYDROGEN PRODUCTION COSTS  5.1     Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)  Hydrogen production capacities, assuming stationary use, are mostly in the range of over 45 000 Nm3-H2/hour. The specific investment costs (i.e. capital investment cost (in € ) divided by hydrogen plant capacity (in kW), are in the range of  210 to 260 € / kW. Operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) cost are comprised between  one and two € / GJ. SMR technology has the least-expensive investment cost in compar  ison to other fossil fuelled hydrogen production methods. 5.2                                                        Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE)  Hydrogen production cost by AWE has been calculated with the following assumptions :  •   Annual hydrogen production capacity : 638 600 x 106 Nm3 •   Capacity factor : 90 % •   Plant lifetime : 20 years •   Capital cost : 500 € / kW   1 Electric efficiency defined as the ratio of the HTR net electric output to the reactor thermal power, i.e. 286,5/600 2 H2 plant global efficiency defined as the ratio of  : [H2 production flow rate (kg/s) x  H  2 LHR (120 MJ/kg)] by  [the electric power requirement of the electrolyser (MWe) x HTR plant electric efficiency]                                                            6</td>

HTE cell costs can presently be assessed only by comparison with fuel cells  costs which have not yet reached an industrial production stage. It is expected that when prod  uced on large scale fuel cell costs should drop by a  factor of 10 at l east from present costs  for R&amp;D applications (20 000 €/kW). For the purpose of t his study a range of 2000 to 200 €/kW was assumed for electrolysis  cells, corresponding to a range of 11 000 to 1000 €/ electrolysis cell. 7</td>

However, the    competitiveness of H+ HTE with respect to other processes remains to be confirmed. •   Coupling of a HTE plant w ith a nuclear reactor     o   The electrical part of the total energy supplied is predominant (260 MWel versus 60        MWth of heat ). The heat is merely  used to vaporize the water at low temperature (54        MWth at 152 °C) and possibly to superheat the steam (6 MWth at 500 °C). o   The coupling of a HTE plant with a PWR is possible in the auto-thermal operating        mode (vaporization of water only), or in the other modes, provided that steam        superheating is performed by a sma ll auxiliary heat source (e.g. an electric boiler). •   Competitiveness     Although it features a lower specific electricity consumption than AWE, HTE is    conceivable only with a very cheap cost of electricity such as from nuclear power p lants,    which absence of Green House Gases reinforce t he interest. 9</td>
