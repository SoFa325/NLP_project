The particular values of net cell heat flux at other operating voltages do however depend on cell ASR and gas compositions. The thermal-neutral voltage increases only slightly in magnitude over the typical operating temperature range for solid-oxide cells, from 1.287 V at 800°C to 1.292 V at 1000°C. At typical solid-oxide electrolysis stack temperatures and  ASR values, operation at the thermal-neutral voltage yields current densities in the 0.2 – 0.6 A/cm2 range, which is very close to the current density range that has yielded successful long-term operation in solid-oxide fuel cell stacks. Operation at or near the thermal-neutral voltage simplifies thermal management of the stack since no significant excess gas flow is required and component thermal stresses are minimized.</td>

Theoretical open-cell potential values are shown in the figure for each sweep using a single data point at zero current density. Sweep 10-1 was performed with a relatively low inlet steam flow rate, corresponding to the low inlet dewpoint value of 48.5ºC and relatively low nitrogen and hydrogen flow rates. This sweep also clearly shows the effects of steam starvation; the slope of the i-V curve increases dramatically as the current density is increased. The outlet dewpoint temperature corresponding to the highest current density shown in this figure was only 4ºC for this sweep. Sweep 10-2 was performed at an intermediate steam concentration, with an inlet dewpoint temperature of 70ºC. Sweep 10-5 has a shallower slope than the others, consistent with the higher operating temperature of 830ºC. This sweep was performed at the of this sweep is small, indicating low ASR     (~1.5 /g525·cm beginning of a 1000-hour long-duration 25-cell stack test. The stack operating temperature was increased form 800°C to 830°C part way through the test.

      <td>37   fixed number of cells. For this plot, the full 600 MWth output of the reactor is assumed to be dedicated to hydrogen production. Under this assumption about four times as many electrolysis cells are required for the high-ASR cases than for the low-ASR cases, with a correspondingly higher associated capital cost. Fig. 32 shows that hydrogen production rates in excess of 2.3 kg/s (92,000 SCMH, 78×106 SCF/day) could be achieved with a dedicated 600 MWth hydrogen- production plant. This rate is the same order of magnitude as a large hydrogen production plant based on steam-methane reforming. 32 indicates similar overall efficiencies for the low- ASR and high-ASR cases at a specified electrolyzer thermal operating condition (adiabatic or isothermal) and hydrogen production rate. The effect of steam utilization was examined by fi xing the electrolyzer inlet process gas flow rates at the values corresponding to the highest current density achievable with each ASR value, then varying the current density over the full range of values considered for the fixed-utilization cases. Low current densities for this case yield low values of steam utilization since the inlet steam flow rate is fixed at a value that yields 89% utilization at the highest current density. Results of this exercise are presented in Fig. 33. The overall efficiency results for the variable- utilization cases nearly collapse onto a single curve when plotted versus utilization. The plot indicates a strong dependence on utilization, with overall hydrogen production efficiencies less than 25% at the lowest utilization values shown (~5.5%), increasing to a maximum value of ~47% at the highest utilization value considered (89%). So, from the overall system perspective, low steam utilization is bad. This is an interesting result because, from the perspective of the electrolyzer alone, low utilization yields high electrolyzer (not overall) efficiency values. Excess steam in the electrolyzer keeps the average Nernst potential low for each cell, which assures a low operating voltage for a specified current density (or hydrogen production rate). However, from the overall system perspective, low steam utilization means that the system is processing                                 60                                50                                40                                30                                           65% of max possi ble                              20          INL ,  HTE  /  He  Re c up  B r a yt o n                                          INL, LTE / He Recup Brayton                                          INL, HTE / Na-cooled Ranki ne                                          INL, LTE / Na-cooled Ranki ne                                          INL, HTE / Sprcrt CO2                              10          INL, LTE / Sprcrt CO2                                          SI Process (GA)                                          MIT -  GT- MHR/ HTE                                          MIT A GR -S C O2 /HTE                               0                                 300                                                                                                           400                                                                                                           500                                                                                                            600                                                                                                           700                                                                                                           800                                                                                                           900                                                                                                1000                                                                             T ( °C)       Figure 34 Overall thermal-to-hydrogen efficiencies (based on HHV) for HTE coupled       to three different reactor types, as a function of reactor outlet temperature.</td>

The syngas production efficiency shown in Fig. The slight drop in syngas production efficiency as the coal moisture content is reduced below 25% is the result of the need to increase the gasifier temperature to maintain a minimum heat exchanger approach temperature for the steam generator of approximately 20°C. This drop in syngas production efficiency is consistent with results that show a drop in syngas production efficiency as the gasifier temperature increased. Note that the syngas production efficiencies for this process are considerably higher than those associated with the purely electrolytic co-electrolysis                            100 process.

Compared to the current hydrogen commodity price of about $2.50/kg (based on steam-      methane reforming), the mean estimated cost is not unreasonable considering the volatility of the      cost of the natural gas and the fact that the HTE technology does not emit greenhouse gases. Estimates of hydrogen production cost based on LTE depend strongly on electricity prices, but      for large systems (1000 kg/day), with an assumed industrial electricity cost of $0.0483/kWh, a      hydrogen selling price of $4.15 (FY2000 dollars) has been reported [36], based on the DOE H2A      methodology. As noted above, the lifecycle cost analysis of the reference HTE design resulted in a      calculated hydrogen cost of $3.23/kg, assuming an after-tax internal rate of return of 10%. This      represents the cost of hydrogen leaving the plant gate, and does not include any additional      storage, delivery, fuel taxes or other costs that the consumer might pay at the pump. A      breakdown of the component costs contributing to the total cost of $3.23/kg shows that capital      costs account for over 70% of total costs (i.e., $2.36/kg of H2). Fixed operating and maintenance costs ($0.57/kg      of H2) are relatively high because they include operation and maintenance costs for both the      reactor and hydrogen production plant. The cost of the SOEC modules was      estimated to be $200/kW of power to the electrolysis stack and it is assumed that 1/3 of the      modules are replaced annually. The feedstock cost contribution ($0.012/kg of H2) represents the      cost of the demineralized water feedstock, which feeds the electrolysis process. Therefore, while the sale of the oxygen byproduct would lower the overall cost of the hydrogen</td>

For example, the base case for the steam/hydrogen inlet used a total inlet mass flow rate of 8.053×10-6 kg/s, with nitrogen, hydrogen and steam mass fractions of 0.51, 0.0074, and 0.483, respectively. The base case air flow rate was 4.33×10-6 kg/s. Model results provide detailed profiles of temperature, Nernst potential, operating potential, anode-side gas composition, cathode-side gas composition, current density and hydrogen production over a range of stack operating conditions. 39 shows predicted voltage-current characteristics and predicted gas outlet temperatures. Note that, for an operating voltage near the thermal minimum (~1.06 V), both models predict outlet temperatures for this particular adiabatic case that are about 30ºC lower than the inlet temperatures. Per-cell gas flow rates for this case were based on the flow rates used in planar HTE stack tests [39, 40]. At this operating voltage, the outlet temperatures are equal to the inlet temperatures under adiabatic conditions.</td>
