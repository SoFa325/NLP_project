(Received 30 January 2023; accepted 17 May 2023) Abstract Solid-oxide fuel cells are efficient devices for the conversion of chemical to electrical energy and a typical solid-oxide fuel cell consists of a solid  electrolyte, cathode, and anode. In the last few decades, researchers have been working extensively on materials development for different compo- nents of these devices. In this review article, we briefly discuss the requirements for different components and review prominent materials families  explored by the scientific community. As the search for greener energy alternatives such as solid-oxide fuel cells has intensified manifold due to the  climate change emergency, a substantial literature was produced on the materials development of these devices and, therefore, we believe a brief  review article dedicated to the same will be valuable for the scientific community, particularly new young entrant researchers in the field.
Introduction Many electrochemical conversion and storage technologies  such as Li-ion and solid-state batteries, fuel cells and capaci - tors are being heavily investigated to decarbonise our environ- ment.[1–8] . Fuel cells are one of the promising technologies  and depending on the nature of the electrolyte used in the fuel  cell that there are various types of fuel cells: Solid-oxide fuel  cell (SOFC), Molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), Polymer  electrolyte (Proton Exchange) Membrane fuel cell (PEMFC),  Phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC), Direct methanol fuel cell 
(DMFC) and Alkaline fuel cells (AFC). Broadly these fuel cell  types can also be classified as high-temperature devices, such  as SOFC and MCFC, and low-temperature devices such as  PEMFC, PAFC, DMFC and AFC. The operating temperature  of different fuel cell types tends to depend on the nature of the  electrolyte being used and is also reflected in the applications  of various fuel cell types.
SOFCs, in particular, have attracted much attention in  recent times. This increased interest in SOFCs stems from  the fact that SOFCs have many advantages over other types  of fuel cells. The flexibility of fuel, which allows the use of  hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and other hydrocarbons  to power the cells is certainly a primary one. Further benefits  include higher efficiency, a step towards a hydrogen-based  economy, low emissions, relatively low cost and scalability,  which allows the stacking of a required number of individual  cells in series depending on the amounts of power needed in a  particular device. It is in this context that SOFCs have assumed  prime importance among the different types of fuel cells, and  we, therefore, believe that a concise review article briefly discussing promising materials families in the field would be  relevant for researchers in the field. For comprehensive long  reviews, we invite the reader to cited review articles here.[9–12] A typical SOFC consists of a solid electrolyte, which sepa- rates the anode and cathode from each other. The cathode acts  as a reduction site and reduces the oxygen being inserted into  the system at the cathode site itself. The oxide ions migrate via  the electrolyte to the anode where they oxidise the fuel, pro - ducing water, heat and more importantly electrons, to perform  useful work (Fig. 1).[13] The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs at the cathode  and the oxide ions produced are transported via an electrolyte  to the anode (Eq. 1 ). It is here at the anode site that the oxide  ions react with fuel (hydrogen gas) to produce electrons (Eq. 2 ).  The electrons generated at the interface of the anode and elec- trolyte are transported to an external circuit for useful work  through the anode. The electrons finally arrive at the cathode  and continue the process.[14] Apart from the anode, cathode and electrolyte, an intercon- nect is used to connect the individual cells in series to gener - ate useful amounts of power. In simple terms, the intercon- nect material is required to combine the current generated by  individual cells, and thus, should ideally possess good elec- tronic conductivity. In addition, it should be chemically stable (1) Cathode Reaction :O2(g)+4e−→2O2−,
(2) Anode Reaction :2H2(g)+2O2−→2H2O(g)+4e,
(3) Overall Reaction :2H2(g)+O2(g)→2H2O(g).

In the following sec - tions of the paper, requirements for different components and  prominent materials families fulfilling the said requirements  will be reviewed in detail.
Materials for cathodes The cathode, being the site for the oxygen reduction reaction 
(ORR), is highly instrumental in determining the performance  of a cell. As electrons are necessary for the reduction of oxy- gen molecules, superior electronic conductivity of the cathode  material is the primary requirement. Low or no chemical reac- tion with other cell components, compatible thermal expansion  coefficient (TEC), and high catalytic activity for the reduction  of an oxygen molecule are other requirements for the cathode  material. The porous microstructure of the cathode material  further enhances the ORR as it ensures the access of oxygen  molecules to the cathode surface, and thus, extends the active  region beyond the restricted triple phase boundary (TPB).
In pure electronic conducting cathode materials such as 
 La1−xSrxMnO3−δ (LSM), ORR is limited to a very narrow TPB  region, the air/cathode/electrolyte interface (Fig. 2 ). The air/ electrolyte interface is immaterial as far as the ORR rate is  concerned because the commonly used electrolyte materials  are catalytically inactive.
Although there is the technical possibility of ORR occur - ring at the air/cathode interface because of insignificant ionic  conduction of pure electronic conductor cathode materials,  the oxide ions produced fails to migrate to the anode for use - ful work. Thus, the practical region for the ORR to occur in  such materials is a very narrow TPB. It is here that so-called  mixed-ionic electronic conducting (MIEC) cathode materials assume crucial importance. The mixed conductivity of MIEC  cathode materials lets the system to extend the otherwise nar - row ORR region and, thus, increase the efficiency of the cell 
(Fig. 2).[15–17] In this regard, the last decade has seen signifi- cant research activity in developing MIEC materials for SOFC  cathodes based on perovskites, double perovskites, Ruddles- den–Popper phases and other layered oxide materials.
Substituted lanthanum manganite In high-temperature SOFCs, La1−xSrxMnO3-δ (LSM), has been  the material of choice for cathodes and has, thus, been explored  extensively.[18,19] The material adopts the perovskite structure  and doping with strontium replaces lanthanum in the structure  and enhances the electronic conductivity of the material by  increasing the hole carriers.[20] Doping the material with Sr  results in the oxidation of Mn3+ to Mn4+ and leaves the oxygen  content of the material intact. Thus, the material achieves a  superior electronic conductivity, in the range of 200–300 Scm−1  at 900°C.[18] But because of the limits imposed by either reac- tivity with other cell components and/or TEC compatibility,  the doping level is usually kept under 30 mol per cent.[10] On  increasing Sr levels beyond this limit, TEC incompatibility[19]  and reactions with other cell components such as the forma- tion of SrZrO3 and La2Zr2O7 with YSZ electrolyte have been  observed (Table I).[21,22] The major challenge, however, with LSM as a cathode has  been its poor oxide-ion conductivity, of the order of 10–7—10–8  S cm−1 at 800°C.[38] The formation of a composite of LSM  with a material of high ionic conductivity has been explored  in the hope that this limitation of low ionic conductivity could  be resolved.[39] Ostergard et al. by using the composites of  LSM + YSZ reduced area-specific resistance (ASR) from  2.7 Ω cm2 obtained by using pure LSM to 0.5 Ωcm2 for an  LSM + YSZ composite operating at 1000°C.[39] However,  because of long-term thermal and mechanical degradation  problems with LSM cathode materials and their low inher - ent oxide-ion conductivity, a search for better materials for  IT-SOFCs continues. The problem arises from the fact that at  Figure 1.  Schematic diagram highlighting the key features of the  operation of a solid-oxide fuel cell. Reproduced with permission  from Ref. 13.

Prospective MRS COMMUNICATIONS · VOLUME XX · ISSUE xx · www.mrs.org/mrc         3high operating temperatures, polarisation losses are negligible  but once the temperature is lowered to the intermediate range,  polarisation losses become significant and, thus, negatively  impact the cell efficiency by decreasing the kinetics associated  with ORR and charge transport at the cell cathode. The cathode  materials based on LSM further suffer from a severe deleterious  problem of strontium segregation, which will be discussed later.
Substituted lanthanum cobaltite LaCoO3 is again a perovskite like LSM and possesses better  electronic conductivity than LSM.[40] The main problem, how - ever, has been the stability[19] of this material which has been  tackled by doping the system with Sr which replaces Ln in the  structure to give the strontium-substituted cobaltite perovskites 
(LSC: La1−xSrxCoO3−δ).[30] LSC is a mixed conductor mate- rial and has shown good ionic conductivity and ORR catalytic  properties.[41–43] The major issue with LSC, however, is its  high TEC, of the order of 20 × 10–6 K−1. When this consider - ably high TEC is compared to the commonly used electrolytes  like YSZ and CGO (~12 × 10–6 K−1), compatibility issues with  other cell components come to the fore and render the material  problematic.[44,45] It has been reported that the high TEC of LSC cathodes  originates from octahedrally coordinated cobalt ion transitions  between low- and high-spin states of the Co3+ 3d6 ion.[45] In  light of this knowledge, Co has been substituted with Fe to pro- duce the state-of-the-art cathode material, La1−xSrxCo1−yFeyO3−δ 
(LSCF). La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3−δ (LSCF6428) is the most prom- ising and studied composition of these materials. The electronic  conductivity of this material is significant, ranging from 350 to  250 S cm−1 in 600–800 temperature range °C.[44] This signifi- cant electronic conductivity of the material originates from the  mixed valencies Fe3+/Fe4+ and Co3+/Co4+, which is essentially  the result of La substitution by Sr. Equally important benefit  of this substitution is the formation of oxygen vacancies in  the LSCF system, which ultimately contributes to the ionic  conductivity of this MIEC cathode material, with 10–2 S cm−1  ionic conductivity at 800°C being reported by Teraoka et al.[46]  Further, the material also has TEC in the range of 15 × 10–6 K−1,  which is in the compatible range of other cell components.[44]The primary limitation of LSCF6428 occurs when it is  used with the commonly used electrolyte because it reacts  with YSZ and negatively impacts cell performance with  time. This reduces the flexibility of this promising cathode  material, and thus, it has primarily been used with the CGO  electrolyte, with which it, fortunately, does not react.[47]  However, because of the common use of the YSZ electrolyte,  several attempts have been made to make LSCF6428 worka - ble with YSZ. A common approach to tackle deleterious reac- tivity has been to incorporate the ceria barrier layer between  the electrolyte and cathode.[48,49] This has also helped in  improving the relatively higher ASR that pure LSCF affords,  0.3 Ω cm2 at 700°C,[50] which is well above the target value  of 0.15 Ω cm2.[51] Dusastre et al. reduced the ASR of pure  LSCF by making composites of LSCF with CGO, reporting  an ASR of 0.16 Ω cm2 at 700°C, almost halving the polarisa- tion resistance.[52] Wang and Mogensen reduced it further to  the remarkable value of 0.026 Ω cm2 at 700°C with CGO and  0.12 Ω cm2 at 700°C with YSZ electrolyte coated with a thin  layer of CGO.[53] But because of the complexity associated  with the use of composites as cathodes, there is the possibil - ity of a reaction between CGO and YSZ to form the less  ionic conducting phase, (Ce, Zr, Gd, Y)O2−δ and it has been  reported that such phases are formed and are responsible for  reducing the cell performance.[54] Above all, the main problem with the promising LSCF  cathode materials is their degradation with time during cell  operation. This problem chiefly manifests itself in strontium  segregation and chromium poisoning. Both of these problems  drastically reduce cell performance. When in operation, Sr  selectively segregates towards the cell surface to form a SrO  layer at the cathode surface, which effectively stops the ORR  from occurring at the air/cathode interface.[55,56] The chromium  poisoning problem emanates from the necessity of using inter - connects to connect the individual cells in series to generate the  required amounts of power for practical purposes. The com- monly used material for interconnects contains chromium, and  it vaporises during cell operation. The harmful impact of chro - mium vapours comes from its deposition on cathode materials,  thereby degrading their performance with time.[57]Table I.

 4    MRS COMMUNICATIONS · VOLUME XX · ISSUE xx · www.mrs.org/mrcThere have been various attempts to resolve this cathode  degradation but not with profound success yet. Use of electri- cal polarisation to de-segregate the strontium[58,59] and use of  acid-etching to reduce the formation of passivating (Ce, Zr, Gd,  Y)O2−δ layers[56,60] and also an attempt to stop Cr poisoning  by coating[61] the steel interconnects have been used but with  less success.
Another related cathode composition is the doped  lanthanum ferrite; LaxSr1−xFeyNi1−yO3−δ (LSFN), with 
 La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3−δ (6428) as the optimum composition.  The material shows electronic conductivity of 300 S cm−1 at  900°C with a reasonable TEC of 14 × 10–6 K−1,[62] but they also  come with their problems of forming insulating phases such  as La2Zr2O7 and SrCoO3 at the interface when used with YSZ  as an electrolyte, which further degrades the performance of  the cell.
Another class of materials, derived from the perovskite  structure are the oxide materials known as double perovskites  with the general formula AA’B2O5+δ where A is a rare-earth  cation, A’ is an alkaline-earth metal cation, and B is a transition  metal cation. In these phases, there is cation ordering of the  rare-earth and alkaline-earth metal layers along the (001) axis.  This leads to a doubling of the c parameter when compared to  the c parameter of the parent perovskite phase.[63] The material  further is an oxygen-deficient system with oxygen vacancies  mainly located in the rare-earth layer. Two compositions, in  particular, GdBaCo2O5+δ (GBCO) and PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO),  have been studied extensively.[64–67] The materials have MIEC  properties but suffer from relatively lower performance, and  thus, composites of GBCO too have been developed for  increased electrochemical performance.[68] LSCF is the most promising material for IT-SOFC cath- odes but because of the degradation issues and strontium seg- regation discussed earlier, the search for alternative IT-SOFC  cathode materials continues. One family suggested as potential  IT-SOFC cathodes are the Ruddlesden–Popper phase materi - als. One of the materials of this family, La2NiO4+δ adopts the 
 K2NiF4-type structure and has been widely studied because of  its remarkable oxide-ion conductivity.
Ruddlesden–Popper phases S. N. Ruddlesden and P. Popper reported a new class of mate- rials with the overall formula of An+1BnO3n+1, in 1958.[69]  The structure consists of nABO3 perovskite layers alternating  between two AO rock-salt layers[70] and the number of per - ovskite polyhedral units packed between rock-salt units of the  structure decides the phase of the material (Fig. 3 ).[71] Since  the perovskite structure allow accommodating oxygen defects  and Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) phases contain perovskite layer/s  in their structure, it is one of the reasons behind the expec- tation that these materials could work as promising oxygen  conductors. It indeed has been found to be true; it is the unique  structural features of lower-order phases such as La2NiO4+δ 
(LNO), Pr2NiO4+δ (PNO), and Nd2NiO4+δ (NNO) which per - mit them to accommodate a substantial amount of interstitial oxygen defects. Ruddlesden–Popper phases’ materials further  take care of strontium segregation problem—a main problem  associated with the state-of-the-art LSCF cathode materials— because Ruddlesden–Popper phases are composed of different  constituents and do not necessarily contain Sr.
Lower-order n = 1 Ruddlesden–Popper phase materials have  a robust capability of storing a considerable amount of intersti- tial oxygen in their structure which bestowed the materials with  significant oxide-ion conductivity. This renders the materials  MIEC at intermediate temperatures which is the main motiva- tion of intense research focus on these materials.[72,73] Thus,  n = 1 phases such as LNO, PNO and NNO have been studied  extensively. With the lower-order phases such as LNO and  PNO, the main issue though is the phase stability under oper - ating conditions, which unfortunately restricts their use as IT- SOFC cathodes.[35,74–78] Even doped lower-order phases such  as cobalt-doped LNO, La2Ni0.9Co0.1O4+δ, studied by Amow and  co-workers observed extensive decomposition.[77] The impurity Ni2+/Ni3+ phase formation at high tempera- tures in the n = 1 R-P phase originates from the In stoichiomet - ric La2NiO4 is, Ni exists mainly in Ni2+ state, which is stable  only at temperatures over 1100°C[79] but in higher-order phases  Ni tend to be predominantly in Ni3+ state, which is favourably  stable below 900°C. Therefore, higher-order phases such as 
 La4Ni3O9.78 (L4N3), Pr4Ni3O10±δ (P4N3) and La2Pr2Ni3O10±δ 
(L2P2N3) comprising predominantly of Ni3+, expectedly offer  long-term stability.[80–82] This was confirmed by Skinner and co-workers who  observed that higher-order phases show increased stability  with no impurity phase appearing after 2 weeks of heating of  n = 2 and 3 phases at 900°C unlike lower-order phases which  Figure 3.

Yatoo and S. Skinner.[87] Materials for electrolytes The electrolyte for SOFCs is a dense ceramic material. It is  through this ceramic layer that oxide ions migrate to the anode  site, and thus, the primary requirement for electrolyte materials  is that they should display very good oxide-ion conductivity.  The internal resistance of an electrolyte material to oxide-ion  transport and the distance to be travelled by oxide ions from  cathode to anode is of utmost importance as far as material  performance is concerned.
Further, to avoid losses and thus have better efficiency,  electrolyte materials ideally should have zero electronic con- ductivity so that electrons generated through the anode reac- tion are not transported through the electrolyte to the cathode  to short-circuit the cell. Further, it should be unreactive with  electrode materials and have a matching TEC with that of other  components of the cell.
The electrolyte for SOFCs is a dense ceramic material. It is  through this ceramic layer that oxide ions migrate to the anode  site, and thus, the primary requirement for electrolyte materials  is that they should display very good oxide-ion conductivity.  Yttria-stabilised zirconia, ZrO2–Y2O3 (YSZ), is the most com- mon electrolyte material for SOFCs.[18,40] It has good mechani- cal properties and is chemically stable over a wide range of  operating temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. The  material is composed of ZrO2, which is stabilised by Y2O3 or  other dopants like MgO and Sc2O3.[40,88] The ionic conductivity  of this electrolyte material depends on the nature and amount  of dopant being used because it is these dopants which create  oxygen vacancies in zirconia, which in turn are responsible for  oxide-ion conduction in the electrolyte.[40,88,89] However, the formation of insulating phases at operating  temperatures when YSZ electrolyte is used with common cath- ode materials such as LSC, LSCM and LSCF, brings chemical  stability issues into the picture, and because insulating phases  like SrZrO3 and La2Zr2O7 have less ionic conductivity than  electrolyte material, the cell performance is reduced with  time.[88–93] Ceria (CeO2) doped with gadolinium ions (Gd3+) has been  found to be promising in terms of its ionic conductivity for use  as a SOFC electrolyte. Ce0.9Gd0.1O1.95 (CGO10) composition  has been found to have better ionic conduction than YSZ.[94,95]  The TEC of CGO10 is 13.5 × 10–6 K−1, thus, making it compat- ible with other cell components.[96] However, in CGO electro- lytes under anodic conditions at operating temperatures, Ce4+  ions are reduced to Ce3+ ions, and this is responsible for n-type  electronic conduction, which short circuits the cell, thereby  reducing the performance.[95,97]Recently magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate, 
 LaxSr1−xGayMg1−yO3−δ (LSGM) because of its good ionic con- ductivity has been used as an electrolyte. This material exhibits  excellent oxide-ion conductivity in the intermediate tempera- ture range and, thus, is suitable for studies where the goal is  to develop materials for IT-SOFCs such as this work.[98] The  origin of this superior ionic conductivity is the vacancies cre- ated in the perovskite structure of lanthanum gallate (LaGaO3)  by doping strontium and magnesium at A and B sites, respec- tively. In particular, two main compositions being used by  researchers are La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.8Mg0.2O3−δ (LSGM8282) and 
 La0.9Sr0.1Ga0.8Mg0.2O3−δ (LSGM9182). LSGM8282 presents  the best ionic conductivity of 0.14 S cm−1 at 700°C as com - pared to the relatively lower value of 0.12 S cm−1 at the same  temperature.[99] These materials further show compatible TEC 
~12.0 × 10–6 K−1 and are, thus, widely used as electrolytes in  IT-SOFCs research. Figure 4 demonstrates the comparison of  ionic conductivity of the three conventional electrolyte materi- als discussed.[100] Materials for anodes The primary role of anode material in a cell is to catalyse the  fuel oxidation and then to conduct the electrons generated by  the oxidation of fuel to the external circuit for useful work.  Thus, a typical anode material should possess the good catalytic  activity and electronic conductivity. It should also have good  ionic conductivity for conducting oxide ions. Furthermore, the  ability of the anode material to catalyse fuel oxidation assumes  significance as far as cell efficiency is concerned.
A typical anode material should possess good catalytic  activity and electronic conductivity to sufficiently fulfil its  primary role to catalyse the fuel oxidation and then to con- duct the electrons generated by oxidation of the fuel to the  Figure 4.

Nickel is a good conductor  and further acts as a catalyst for hydrogen oxidation, but  because of high TEC, it is not mechanically compatible with  electrolytes such as YSZ.[12] Therefore, nickel on its own as  anode is avoided but is used in the form of a composite.
A recent trend in developing anode materials is to have  MIEC materials with a porous structure. Nickel, because  of its good catalytic properties and economic viability, is  the most common material used for anodes.[18] Ni dispersed  over YSZ is, thus, the most commonly used anode mate- rial,[101] and there are also reports where cermets of Ni with  ceria doped with gadolinia—that is Ni-CGO—outperform  the Ni–YSZ anode.[102] The main problem with Ni–YSZ is  that it suffers from carbon deposition and sulphur poisoning  which negatively impacts the electrochemical performance  of the devices based on this anode. Despite the shortcom- ings, Ni–YSZ is a state-of-the-art anode for high-tempera - ture SOFCs because of its high electrochemical activity and  mechanical stability.
For intermediate temperature SOFCs, however, Ni–CGO  is the popular anode material. While CGO on its own lacks  electronic conductivity—which is, therefore, compensated by  addition of Ni—it shows high ionic conductivity.[103] A further  drawback of Ni–CGO anode is its mechanical strength, but it  shows reduced carbon deposition when used with hydrocar - bon fuels and, therefore, is a vital alternative to Ni–YSZ-based  anode materials.[104] The anode, however, is relatively less sig- nificant than the electrolyte and cathode because of its less  limiting role in cell performance.
Conclusions Arguably the most significant series of conferences—the United  Nations Climate Change Conference—was recently concluded  in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt. More commonly referred to as the  Conference of the Parties (COP), it is the 27th edition (COP27)  and lays bare the significance of the devastating impact of fossil  fuels on our environment. In this context, technologies such  as SOFCs assume central importance and, therefore, require a  particular focus by scientists and technologists. Advancement  in the search for new materials is one way to solve the chal- lenges faced by energy storage and conversion technologies  and SOFCs are one such technology where advancement in  materials has proved critical. There are further many opportu- nities to develop layered oxide materials such as perovskites,  double perovskites and Ruddlesden–Popper phase materials,  including the development of composite electrodes for both  fuel cell and electrolysis modes of operation. In this review  article, we discussed the prominent materials families cur - rently being investigated by the SOFCs community for differ - ent components of SOFCs, and we believe that looking for new  materials families and improving the performance of already  identified materials will be instrumental in further developing  the SOFCs technology.Open Access
