Highly efﬁcient high temperature electrolysis † Anne Hauch, *Sune Dalgaard Ebbesen, Søren Højgaard Jensen and Mogens Mogensen Received 5th December 2007, Accepted 3rd January 2008 First published as an Advance Article on the web 31st January 2008DOI: 10.1039/b718822f High temperature electrolysis of water and steam may provide an efﬁcient, cost effective and environmentally friendly production of H 2using electricity produced from sustainable, non-fossil energy sources. To achieve cost competitive electrolysis cells that are both high performing i.e.minimum internal resistance of the cell, and long-term stable, it is critical to develop electrode materials that are optimal for steam electrolysis. In this article electrolysis cells for electrolysis of water or steam at temperatures above 200/C14C for production of H 2are reviewed. High temperature electrolysis is favourable from a thermodynamic point of view, because a part of the required energy can be suppliedas thermal heat, and the activation barrier is lowered increasing the H 2production rate. Only two types of cells operating at high temperature (above 200/C14C) have been described in the literature, namely alkaline electrolysis cells (AEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). In the present review emphasisis on state-of-the art electrode materials and development of new materials for SOECs. Based on thestate-of-the-art performance for SOECs H 2production by high temperature steam electrolysis using SOECs is competitive to H 2production from fossil fuels at electricity prices below 0.02–0.03 Vper kWh.
Though promising SOEC results on H 2production have been reported a substantial R&D is still required to obtain inexpensive, high performing and long-term stable electrolysis cells.
1. Introduction In recent years there has been an increased focus on H 2as an energy carrier due to parameters such as limited fossil fuelsources, increasing oil prices and environmental aspects suchas emission of CO 2and NO x. Most of today’s H 2is produced viasteam reforming and the main part is synthesised to chemicals
(ammonia, methanol etc.) at the production facilities. However from an environmental point of view H 2production by steamreforming is not optimal because the fossil fuel feed is based on consuming non-renewable fuels and furthermore CO 2is emit- ted. Consequently it is necessary to develop cost competitive,efﬁcient and environmental friendly means of H 2production, preferably using renewable energy sources such as solar energyand wind power. Electrolysis of steam can provide H 2at high efﬁciency and high purity. Furthermore electrolysis cells can beapplied to optimise the efﬁciency of intermittent sources suchas wind power and utilise waste heat and surplus energy from e.g.nuclear power facilities during off-peak hours.
In parallel with the increased interest in H 2production there has also been considerable—and successful—R&D work worldwide to develop high performing and long-term stable fuel cells.Such cells can typically work both as fuel cells for electricityproduction and as electrolysis cells for H 2production.

 / Table of Contents for this issue When operated as an electrolysis cell the overall endothermic reaction is: 2H 2O + electrical energy ( DG) + heat ( TDS)/2H2+O 2.
From basic thermodynamic considerations it is advantageous to operate the electrolysis cells at high temperatures where asubstantial part of the required energy is provided as thermal energy and consequently the primary electric energy demand
(DG), is considerably reduced. On the contrary, for low tempera- ture electrolysis a larger quantity of electrical energy is necessaryto overcome the endothermic heat of reaction. Furthermore, athigh temperature the kinetics of the electrolysis reactionsincrease, resulting in a decrease in electrical losses in the cellbecause of the lower ohmic resistance in the electrolyte and lowerpolarisation losses from the electrode reactions.
It is natural to consider well known types of fuel cells as a starting point for electrolysis cells to gain from the substantialknowledge on fundamental material properties (conductivity, thermal expansion coefﬁcient etc.) and optimised manufacturing techniques for these cells. However, the material demandschange upon reversing the operation mode of the cells.Compared to fuel cells, the electrolysis cells are operated witha high water or steam content at the inlet to the H 2electrode and a high H 2O fuel utilisation to minimise gas recycling, high temperature will be favourable and parameters such as potentialand concentration gradients will be changed compared to fuelcell operation of the cells.
The different types of electrolysis cells will be discussed with emphasis on electrode materials and problems occurring when operating these cells at high temperature, which in this context is deﬁned as above 200
/C14C. Potentially, alkaline cells could be developed to operate at high temperatures and this issue is dealtwith in Section 2. However, the focus will be on the productionof H 2using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) as these cells are normally operated at temperatures between 800 and 1000/C14C.
The emphasis is on the electrode material issues for the SOECsbecause this plays a key role in the development of these cellsto become cost competitive, high performing and long-termstable SOECs for efﬁcient and environmentally friendly H 2 production. Even though promising electrolysis results have been obtained for SOECs it is evident that substantial develop- ment of electrode material is necessary to obtain highly perform-ing and long-term stable electrolysis cells. Perspectives for futurelarge scale H 2production by electrolysis of steam using SOECs will be analysed together with economic estimates for thepotential production price.
Types of electrolysis cells Well known fuel cells are polymer exchange membrane fuel cells
(PEMFC), phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC), alkaline fuel cells(AFC), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuelcells (SOFC). The PEM cells typically operate at temperaturesaround 70–80
/C14C, have graphite electrodes with highly dispersed—and expensive—Pt catalysts and a proton conducting polymer membrane as the electrolyte. PEM electrolyser cells
(PEMECs) for H 2production are commercially available, but are even more expensive than PEMFC because the carboncatalyst carrier used in the fuel cells oxidises fast under the highly oxidising conditions at the oxygen evolution electrode and othermaterials e.g.based on titanium alloys may be used as catalyst carrier.
1As mentioned, it is thermodynamically advantageous to operate the electrolysis cells at high temperature; howeverthis does not appear to be possible for PEM cells because theapplied polymer membrane electrolyte cannot withstand long-term operation in strong oxidising conditions at the anodicpolarised oxygen electrode at high temperature.
The PAFCs are operated at 150–200
/C14C, use orthophosphoric acid as the proton conducting electrolyte and Pt as catalyst oncarbon support for both electrodes. Again, the carbon supportedelectrodes in PAFCs cannot withstand the oxidising conditionsat high temperatures. Therefore, from a basic material point of view, PEM and phosphoric acid cells will hardly become the preferred types of electrolysis cells for large scale inexpensiveH 2production. However, PEM and phosphoric acid cells can be relevant for speciﬁc purposes where a low temperature isimportant and cost is not a key issue.
For the MCFCs a molten carbonate is used as a CO 32/C0 conducting electrolyte, porous Ni is used as the H 2electrode and a mixture of NiO and Li 2O is used for the O 2electrode.
From an ‘‘electrolysis-thermodynamic’’ point of view moltencarbonate cells are operated at more relevant temperaturesaround 650
/C14C. However, molten carbon electrolysis cells
(MCEC) are not preferable as electrolysis cells for pure H 2 production because CO 2is involved in the electrode reactions, which implies that for each mol of H 2evolved; one mol of CO 2 must be transferred as carbonate through the electrolyte. Thisincreases the complexity of the electrochemical reactions in theelectrodes which in turn will lead to a lower overall efﬁciency.
Solid oxide cells (SOC) have been applied for electrolysis of steam, but most commonly used—and commercially available—are low temperature ( /C2480
/C14C) alkaline cells for electrolysis.
These cells have to be operated at rather high cell voltages.This causes heat production in spite of the electrolysis process being endothermic. These high cell voltages are necessary in order to achieve an acceptable H 2production rate. Increasing the temperature to above 200/C14C increases the electrode reaction rate to an acceptable extent with low enough cell voltages thatthe cell is self-cooled (thermoneutral potential). High tempera-ture alkaline electrolysis cells (HT-AEC) will be described inthe next section. Electrode material aspects of solid oxideelectrolysis cells (SOEC) are described in detail in Section 3.
2. High temperature alkaline electrolysis cells Water is a very poor ionic conductor, and ions must be added inorder to form a conductive electrolyte (mainly potassium andsodium hydroxide solutions) so the reaction can proceed withouttoo high resistance. Most commercial AEC are operated at 70–80
/C14C with a potassium hydroxide electrolyte (25–30 wt%) and nickel electrodes. As described in the previous section, increasingthe operating temperature is favourable as the necessary electri-cal energy input is lowered. To the best of our knowledge onlyvery limited experimental data for alkaline electrolysis at temper- atures at 200
/C14C and above has been reported.2–4Nevertheless it was shown that the efﬁciency of water electrolysis for productionof H 2over polished nickel electrodes increases signiﬁcantly at 2332 | J. Mater. Chem. , 2008, 18, 2331–2340 This journal is ªThe Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Published on 31 January 2008. Downloaded by DTU Library on 28/07/2015 12:29:53.  View Article Online high temperature as shown in Fig. 1.3Fig. 1 shows that an increase in temperature has a more pronounced effect on theoxygen evolution (OER) than the H 2evolution (HER) reaction.
Increasing the temperature signiﬁcantly shifts the OER to lower potentials, which reﬂects a higher activation energy for OERcompared to HER.
3Only small shifts in potential were observed for HER at temperatures above 200/C14C at low current densities.
Nevertheless, substantial polarisations are found for the H 2 evolution reaction on nickel electrodes in alkaline solutions atlower temperatures.
3The dual region of the Tafel slope was explained by a change in mechanism caused by the magneticproperties of nickel, although at present the exact mechanismis not fully understood. Regardless of the interpretation of theTafel slopes, it is evident that an increase in temperature signiﬁ- cantly improves the kinetics of both O 2and H 2evolution, and electrolysis at high temperatures would be beneﬁcial.
The materials known to be applicable for alkaline electrolysis are very limited because of the highly corroding electrolyte solu-tion and they become increasingly limited at high temperatures.
Both platinum and palladium show lower polarisation for oxygen evolution than nickel, but because of economicalreasons, nickel is almost exclusively used in conventional electro-lysers.
5,6To decrease the polarisation, several alloys (Ti–Ni7and Ni–Ir, Ni–Ru, Ni–Mo8) were tested and showed slightly lower polarisation. For pure nickel electrodes, mainly Raney-nickel, i.e. leached nickel–aluminium or nickel–zinc alloy is used, because of the high active surface area and porosity. Otherhighly porous materials such as Pt/C were suggested as alterna-tives to the nickel electrodes.
9–11 Most electrode materials have been tested at temperatures up to 160/C14C with a slight increased thermal degradation at high temperature.5–7,12,13Conventional nickel electrodes were shown to withstand temperatures of at least 200/C14C, as they were used for the Apollo fuel cell system, normally operated at 204/C14C and successfully tested at temperatures of 260/C14C.14 The separators/diaphragms serve as an ionic conducting material as well as separating the product gasses. Separation of the product gasses becomes increasingly important at highpressure (necessary at high temperature operation) where oxygenbecome highly soluble in the electrolyte. For low temperature electrolysers, the separator/diaphragm can be nickel oxide,asbestos or polymer. Both the polymers and asbestos become instable at temperatures above 120
/C14C.15Consequently, new separator/diaphragm materials should be developed for HT-AEC. Oxide-ceramic diaphragms such as ceramics of titanates(BaTiO 3and CaTiO 3) or even NiO15–17can be suitable substi- tutes for the polymeric or asbestos separators/diaphragmswhen operated at high temperatures.
3. Solid oxide electrolysis cells As for PEM cells and AECs, noble metals can be used for SOCelectrodes for electrolysis cells that work reversibly across opencircuit voltage (OCV) and recently Hickey et al.
18showed initial performance results and how such SOCs with noble metalelectrodes can withstand fuel cell/electrolysis cycling forhundreds of hours. In spite of the fact that scientiﬁcally interest-ing results can be and have been obtained for SOECs using noblemetal electrodes, they are too expensive to be relevant in thedevelopment of technologically and commercially relevant SOECs. The following review for SOECs will be focused on cost competitive choices for SOEC electrodes, i.e.electrodes based on ceramic materials and inexpensive catalysts.
For the choice of materials for SOECs it is natural to consider the well-known materials used for SOFCs, for which substantialR&D efforts have been used to investigate parameters such asconductivity, catalytic activity, matching thermal expansioncoefﬁcient, processing techniques etc.
Already in the early 1980s Do ¨nitz, Isenberg and others reported on SOECs that basically used electrolyte and electrodematerials that are still used for state-of-the-art SOECs.
19–22As for SOFCs the dense oxide ion conducting electrolyte consisting of 8 mol% Y 2O3stabilised ZrO 2(YSZ) is typically used for SOEC, which is used together with Ni in the porous cermet H 2 electrode. The most commonly used material for the porous O 2 electrode is a composite of YSZ and strontium doped lanthanummanganite (LSM). SOEC tests reported in the 1980s were mainlyperformed on tubular formed SOECs (HotElly project 19and Westinghouse Electrical Corporation22) with a porous oxygen electrode tube as cell support. In recent years planar cells havebeen preferable for SOECs where both electrolyte supported 23,24 and H 2electrode supported cells have been applied.25SOECs have been tested at temperature ranging from 700/C14C to 1000
/C14C and at ambient pressure and at steam-to-hydrogen ratios from 30 : 70 to 99 : 1.26Compared to long-term tests of SOFC, only relatively few long-term electrolysis tests have been reportedand unfortunately only a few include thorough analysis of thedegradation mechanisms e.g. by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) before, during and after electrolysis testingand by scanning and transmission electron microscopy com-bined with micro analysis of chemical compositions. Thereforemany material aspects needs to be investigated in detail e.g.
initial performance of electrodes including ‘‘new’’ materials,long-term stability, effect of cycling (temperature, operation mode etc.), effect of impurities in the raw materials, effect of manufacturing and also optimal materials for auxiliary compo-nents, sealing etc. In the following the emphasis will be on Fig. 1 Potential vs.current density for hydrogen and oxygen evolution on polished nickel electrodes in 50 wt% KOH solutions at temperatures from 80/C14C to 264/C14C.3Reproduced by permission from The Electro- chemical Society.

3.1. State-of-the-art H 2electrodes for SOECs The state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ cermet H 2electrodes have been applied for three decades by now. Nevertheless, signiﬁcantlydifferent performance results have been reported for SOECswith Ni/YSZ electrodes 25illustrating that manufacturing, and thereby the electrode microstructure, highly inﬂuence theelectrode performance.
The Ni/YSZ network of catalytically active and electron conductive Ni and ionic conductive stabilised zirconia providesfast kinetics for the involved electrode reactions and the porous(/C2430% porosity) structure ensures fast diffusion in the H 2 electrode supported cells. However, it is well known that there is a fundamental material challenge regarding the non-optimal redox stability of Ni/YSZ cermet based H 2electrodes which is a disadvantage that should be noticed as this possibly will makeH 2recycling a necessity. The redox stability issue may not be of importance for SOEC testing on a laboratory scale, but for futurecost competitive SOEC systems it will be an issue to consider.
Initial performance. High initial performances have been reported on SOEC with Ni/YSZ H 2electrode and Ni/YSZ support layer. Fig. 2 shows iVcurves for high performing SOECs with Ni/YSZ H 2electrodes. Using the chord of the electrolysis iV curve for the highest performing SOC an area speciﬁc resistance
(ASR)‡ as low as 0.27 Ucm2was obtained at 850/C14C,p(H2O)/ p(H2)¼0.5/0.5 for a full cell.25For similar cells tested as SOFCs it was found that at 850/C14C approximately 25% of the resistance of the cell in this cell conﬁguration is caused by processes in the H 2 electrode.27Slightly lower initial performance on single SOECs was obtained by O’Brien et al.24,28on electrolyte supported button cells with Ni/YSZ electrodes e.g.an ASR of 0.35 Ucm2at 850/C14C and Marina et al.29obtained an ASR resistance of /C240.9Ucm2at 800/C14C and p(H2O)/p(H2)¼0.5/0.5 for a 500 mm Ni/YSZ electrode supported cell. Furthermore, Marina and co-workers29measured on Ni/YSZ-YSZ half-cells in both fuel cell and electro-lysis mode, which has not often been reported.
30At 800/C14C, a polarisation of 50 mV and p(H2O)/p(H2)¼0.5/0.5 they obtained an ASR half-cell of 0.26 Ucm2for fuel cell operation and 0.29 Ucm2 for electrolysis operation for the same cell. The same trend, that Ni/YSZ seems to have a higher activity towards oxidation ofH 2than reduction of H 2O, was recently reported for H 2electrode supported cells25and YSZ electrolyte supported cells.31,23xFor a durable high performing Ni/YSZ cermet electrode, long-termstability of the electrode microstructure is necessary to maintaina high number of active sites and optimal transport of gaseousreactants and products to and from these sites. Already in the1980s a long-term stability of 1000 hours of a Ni/YSZ electrodein electrolyte supported tubular SOECs was reported by Do ¨nitz and co-workers. Fig. 3 shows a 1000 h durability test for such an electrolyte supported single SOEC.
19No signiﬁcant degrada- tion was observed indicating a stable microstructure. TheNi/YSZ electrode microstructure was relatively coarse 19which resulted in a large area speciﬁc polarisation resistance of /C240.23 Ucm2{at 1000/C14C19whereas the ASR for today’s state-of-the art SOECs was reported to be around 0.17 Ucm2at 950/C14C for a full cell including the ohmic resistance.32Unfortunately, satisfying electron microscopy evidence for the stability of themicrostructure was not reported by Do ¨nitzet al.
Ni/YSZ electrode microstructure. By applying an inexpensive production method such as tape casting, it is possible to produceplanar SOECs with a microstructure as illustrated in Fig. 4A fora non-tested SOEC 26,33which have a mean Ni particle size of 1.00
/C60.05mm and a high porosity. Essentially no signiﬁcant change Fig. 2 Initial electrolysis (negative current densities) and fuel cell perfor- mance recorded by iVcurves at 850/C14C,p(H2O)/p(H2)¼0.5/0.5 for a high and lower performing H 2electrode supported SOC.25Reproduced by permission from The Electrochemical Society.
Fig. 3 Long-term electrolysis testing of a single electrolyte supported tubular SOEC with Ni/YSZ H 2electrode reported by Do ¨nitz et al.19 Test conditions were: 995/C14C,/C00.3 A cm/C02and H 2/H2O¼1⁄2. The measured cell voltage of 1.07 V corresponds to a cell polarisation of 0.23 V i.e.a resistance of the cell of 0.78 Ucm2. Reproduced by permis- sion from Elsevier.
‡ ASR values are those given in the text in the references or calculated from the chord of the iV curves in linear regions and are therefore not corrected for fuel or steam utilisation.xIn the text by O’Brien et al.23it was only stated that ‘‘ASR values are similar for both fuel-cell and electrolysis modes of operation’’, however from Fig. 5 and Fig. 10, especially sample E6 and ss14, it can beobserved that ASR in electrolysis mode is slightly higher than ASR infuel cell mode for the same cell.

View Article Online in the microstructure of Ni/YSZ was observed during electrolysis for 1500 h at 850/C14C,/C00.5 A cm/C02and p(H2O)/p(H2)¼0.5/0.5
(comparison of Fig. 4A, reference cell, and Fig. 4C, electrolysistested cell). k 26Also no delamination of the Ni/YSZ electrode from the dense YSZ electrolyte was observed (comparison ofFig. 4B, reference cell, and Fig. 4D, electrolysis tested cell). A thorough analysis of the Ni particle size distributions revealed that the mean Ni particle size increased from 1.00 /C60.05mm for a non-tested cell to 1.25 /C60.05mm after electrolysis testing independent of whether the cell was tested for 150 hours or1500 hours. However this change in the mean Ni particle sizeis not the main degradation mechanism for these SOECs.
26 Similar change in the mean Ni particle size was observed for cellswith the same initial Ni/YSZ microstructure when tested in fuelcell mode 34Consequently, it is possible to produce cells with ﬁne Ni/YSZ microstructures which are as stable over thousands ofhours of electrolysis testing as over thousands of hours of fuel cell testing. However, signiﬁcant microstructural changes were observed for the innermost few microns of the Ni/YSZ electrodeclosest to the electrolyte for SOECs tested at more harsh condi- tions i.e.at current densities higher than /C01Ac m
/C02.26 Degradation of Ni/YSZ electrodes. Although Ni/YSZ cermet electrodes have microstructures that can sustain thousand ofhours of electrolysis testing at moderate current densities (below
/C01Ac m
/C02), there are other material issues leading to degrada- tion of the Ni/YSZ cermet electrode. Relatively limited numbersof long-term electrolysis tests of SOECs have been reportedapplying ‘‘up-to-date’’ Ni/YSZ electrode microstructure.Ceramatec and Idaho National Laboratory (INL) reportedlong-term electrolysis tests of SOECs applying state-of-the-art‘‘up-to-date’’ Ni/YSZ electrodes.
24Although they stated that a ‘‘stable performance was demonstrated’’ for their single celltest the corresponding cell voltage and development of cellresistance during electrolysis testing for 300 hours revealed anincrease in cell resistance from 0.5 Ucm 2to 0.62 Ucm2, corres- ponding to an increase in cell voltage of /C2420% per 1000 hours at 800/C14C and /C00.7 A cm/C02. Unfortunately Ceramatec and INL did not provide data (EIS or micro analysis and electronmicroscopy) that could identify at which electrode the degrada-tion occur.

View Article Online on single cells with Ni/YSZ H 2electrodes.26The cells were found to degrade faster in electrolysis mode than fuel cell testing ofsimilar SOCs.
26,34In electrolysis mode the cells were found to have a cell voltage degradation of 2% per 1000 h at /C00.5 A cm/C02 and 850/C14C, and by applying EIS it was found that the majority of the increased polarisation resistance was caused by a loss inperformance of the Ni/YSZ electrode.
26Electron microscopy
(SEM, transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmis-sion electron microscopy) combined with energy dispersive spec-troscopy (EDS) revealed that a glassy phase containing silicaimpurities had built up at the triple-phase-boundaries (TPB) ofthe H 2electrode as illustrated by the EDS map in Fig. 5.35Accu- mulation of silica containing impurities at the grain boundariesand TPBs was previously reported for model systems 36and half cells37and impurities in the raw materials greatly inﬂuences the performance the Ni/YSZ system.38Glassy phase impurities accumulated at the TPBs of the Ni/YSZ electrode upon electroly-sis operation can be expected to have different composition andphysical properties compared to impurities observed for fuel celltested cells due to the differences in e.g.potential and concentra- tion gradients and amount of H 2O incorporated in the glass phase.Beside impurities in the raw materials the build-up of impurities can originate from ‘‘external’’ sources such as glass sealing33which is usually not considered a Si-source during SOFC testing. A considerable p(Si(OH) 4) exist over the glass sealing material at electrolysis operation conditions and form SiO 2upon reduction of steam in the Ni/YSZ electrode near the electrolyte. Contamina-tion of the Ni/YSZ electrode from an ‘‘external’’ source i.e.the glass sealing could be eliminated by coating of the glass seal orby applying a seal less test set-up for electrolysis testing as recentlyreported by Brisse ´et al.
39and previously by Westinghouse Electri- cal Corporation.40Westinghouse presented SOEC test results on tubular cells where slurry coat electrochemical vapour deposition(EVD) was applied to manufacture the Ni/YSZ electrode andEVD was used to produce the YSZ electrolyte.
22,41EVD has the advantages that the thickness of the layer can be controlled to within one micron and EVD provides electrolytes and electrodeswith high purity, but the EVD process is incompatible with thedemand for cost competitive production of SOCs.
42,43 Main challenges for state-of-the-art H 2electrodes. As described in the previous section, inexpensive preparation methods thatcan easily be scaled up are available for production of Ni/YSZcermet electrodes with a high performing microstructure thatcan withstand thousand of hours of electrolysis testing. TheNi/YSZ cermet electrode is absolutely promising for H 2 electrodes for technologically relevant SOECs. Nevertheless,the degradation rates for state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ electrode inSOECs are too high. At present the main challenge appears tobe to minimise and/or control glassy phase impurities thataccumulate at the TPBs in the Ni/YSZ and thereby hamper theelectrochemical reaction. A cell and test system completely freeof impurities such as Si and Na is hardly an option especiallynot when costs are considered. As previously reported a possiblesolution could be to use a Si scavenger such as Al 2O344–46or to change the properties of the glassy phase impurities by the useof dopant glass modiﬁers such as potassium or vanadium oxides.
47,48It will be a demanding task to reach an optimal scav- enger/dopant with several problems: 1) the knowledge regardingthe composition and physical properties of the glass phaseimpurities in the electrode is limited and will depend on para-meters such as operating conditions, raw materials and produc-tion, 2) the optimal quantity and distribution of the scavenger inthe Ni/YSZ electrode need to be determined and 3) Ni/YSZelectrodes with such scavengers/dopants should still be manufac-tured using inexpensive production methods.
Furthermore, there is a possibility that other impurities are present in quantities large enough to inﬂuence the performance of the Ni/YSZ electrode even though such impurity elements have not been detected in Ni/YSZ electrodes yet. Less thanone mono-layer of impurities at the reaction sites might be sufﬁ-cient to signiﬁcantly hamper the electrode reactions.
3.2. Alternative H 2electrode materials for SOECs Alternative materials have been considered and tested as H 2 electrodes for SOECs. Uchida and co-workers have reported on a H 2electrode of samaria doped ceria (SDC) with highly dispersed nanosized Ni particles.49–51They found that the optimal load of Ni was approximately 17 vol% at which the Fig. 5 a) An HAADF STEM micrograph and b) an EDS map of alumina–silicate impurity at a TPB a couple of microns from the electro- lyte/electrode interface.

49The polarisation resistance of the SDC based H 2electrode with optimal load of nanosized Ni particles was 0.18 Ucm2at 900/C14C. This electrode is promising, however, the resistance it is still too high considering an internalresistance of 0.27 Ucm 2at 850/C14C for a full cell including polari- sation resistances of both electrodes and ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and auxiliary layers has been reported.25Long-term test of cells with a similar SDC H 2electrode with highly dispersed nanosized Ni particle was reported to be stable over 1100 h of fuelcell testing in humidiﬁed H 2at 800/C14C and 0.6 A cm/C02but to the best of our knowledge results on long-term electrolysis testing e.g.
at high p(H2O) and various temperatures and current densities for such SDC/Ni H 2electrodes have not been reported.
Titanate based H 2electrodes have also been developed for both SOFC and SOEC.29,52Marina et al.29compared a standard Ni/YSZ electrode with a titanate/ceria based electrode
(La 0.35Sr0.65TiO 3/Ce 0.5La0.5O1.75 /C0d) and found that from iV curves at 800/C14C and p(H2O)/p(H2)¼0.5/0.5, the Ni/YSZ elec- trode was superior in fuel cell mode but the titanate/ceria basedelectrode showed a lower polarisation resistance (0.21 Ucm 2)i n electrolysis mode than the Ni/YSZ electrode (0.29 Ucm2).
Increased performance in electrolysis mode compared to fuelcell mode was also reported for strontium titanates of similarcompositions by Blennow.
52However, Marina et al. observed a signiﬁcant reversible drop in initial performance of thetitanate/ceria based electrode upon increasing the p(H 2O)/p(H2) ratio from 0.8/0.2 to 0.9/0.1 as shown in Fig. 6. It was argued that this could be explained in terms of the decreased electrical conductivity of titanate/ceria composites at reduced pO2.
3.3. State-of-the-art O 2electrodes for SOECs The state-of-the-art O 2electrode is a composite of Sr doped LaMnO 3and YSZ (LSM-YSZ),43and is widely applied.25,28,31,41,53–55Problems with delamination of the O 2 electrode from the electrolyte were reported18,31,56and might be caused by pressure differences occurring upon O 2evolution in closed pores in the electrode/electrolyte interface.31Such delami- nation can hardly be considered a purely material chemistryproblem but is rather a question of optimising the preparationsteps to preserve the contact between the electrolyte and the LSM based electrode as observed even after 1500 hours ofelectrolysis testing (Fig. 4). Inexpensive production methods such as spraying and screen printing can be applied when producing LSM based O 2electrodes with microstructures able to sustain thousands of hours as O 2evolution electrode during electrolysis testing.
When tested in fuel cell mode degradation of O 2electrodes based on stoichiometric LSM caused by formation of secondaryphases that are poorly conductive such as La 2Zr2O7or SrZrO 3 was reported.57–62So far only a few reports on electrolysis tests with degradation of the LSM based O 2electrode e.g. caused by such secondary phases have been published.63Nanoscale chemical analyses e.g. by EDS in a FEG-TEM/STEM for LSM electrodes of long-term tested SOECs are required to inves- tigate a phenomenon such as formation of secondary phases.
3.4. Alternative O 2electrode materials for SOECs Even though the LSM based oxygen electrode appears to be applicable for long-term testing of SOECs alternative O 2 electrodes were reported.31,54,55,64Wang et al. obtained higher performances when LSM was substituted with mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIEC) such as Sr doped LaFeO 3(LSF) or even better with Sr doped LaCoO 3(LSCo) in both electrolysis and fuel cell mode.55The improved initial performance for LSF and LSCo oxygen electrodes found by Wang et al. is evident from the electrolysis iVcurves shown in Fig. 7 obtained on electrolyte supported (100 mm) cells with Co–CeO 2–YSZ H 2elec- trodes at 700/C14C. It should be noted that at higher temperature, e.g. above 800/C14C which will be most relevant for electrolysis operation of the SOCs, a barrier layer will be required for O 2 electrodes such as LSF and LSCo to avoid formation of insulat-ing secondary phases at the electrode/YSZ electrolyte. Thestability of the LSF-YSZ electrode was only tested for 5 hoursat 700
/C14C by Wang et al.55and this does not provide evidence for the long-term chemical and microstructural stability of their oxygen electrode for SOECs.
Also Momma et al.31have reported on the use of LaCoO 3 based electrodes. They were unsuccessful using an electrode of Fig. 6 iVcurves for a H 2electrode of La 0.35Sr0.65TiO 3/Ce 0.5La0.5O1.75/C0d at various p(H2O)/p(H2)a t8 0 0/C14C. From O.

View Article Online LSM as the electrode delaminated from the YSZ electrolyte and therefore tested LaCoO 3based electrodes with various Sr content. Momma et al.31found similar degradation rates for non-doped LaCoO 3electrode as LSM.
The non-doped LaCoO 3had the best initial performance but after only 80 hours of electrolysis testing at /C00.5 A cm/C02and 1000/C14C the cell with the non-doped LaCoO 3reached the same degree of degradation as the cells with Sr-doped LaCoO 3 electrodes.
3.5. Alternative electrolyte materials for SOECs Even though YSZ is by far the most commonly used electrolyte for SOECs some authors have reported on different alternativeelectrolyte materials 28,49,54,65,66and it was shown that the choice of electrolyte material can inﬂuence the electrode performance.Osada et al.
49showed that the resistance of their Ni–SDC H 2 electrode was lowered signiﬁcantly in the temperature interval from 700–900/C14C upon changing the electrolyte material from YSZ to the more expensive, but more conductive scandiastabilised zirconia, ScSZ. A positive effect on the electrodeperformances in electrolysis mode has also been obtained uponsubstituting the YSZ electrolyte with a samaria-doped CeO 2 electrolyte54but Eguchi et al.54found the H 2evolution rate for the cell with a SDC electrolyte was far too low at the appliedcurrent; most likely because of reduction of Ce 4+to Ce3+(deterio- ration of ionic transference number) from the H 2electrode side.
From an SOEC stack point of view it can be advantageous dueto cost reduction to optimise SOECs for operating at a reduced temperature e.g. 700–800
/C14C where YSZ is not an optimal electrolyte. An alternative electrolyte for such purpose couldbe doped lanthanum gallate e.g.with Sr on the La site and Mg on the Ga site (LSGM) as reported by Elangovan et al.
65 However this will also require modiﬁcations of the Ni based H2electrode to avoid the formation of LaNiO 367–70as the Ni volume percentage (typically /C2440%) cannot be lowered enough to avoid the thermodynamic driving force towards LaNiO 3 formation and still sustain its electrical continuity.
4. Perspectives for H 2generation viaelectrolysis at high temperatures When evaluating the commercial potential of steam electrolysis, it is important to be aware that hydrogen may be produced byseveral other methods. Today production of H 2from fossil fuels is cheaper and more efﬁcient than H 2from other sources. H 2can be produced from fossil fuels viareforming, partial oxidation or coal gasiﬁcation, all with a high efﬁciency in the order of 60–85%.
71The disadvantages of H 2production from fossil fuels are the depleting resources as well as emission of CO 2. Besides production of H 2from fossil fuels, H 2may be produced viabio- logical processes (efﬁciency of around 10%72), thermo chemical cycles ( e.g.zinc oxide–oxide and iodine–sulfur cycles, efﬁciency of 30–40%73,74) photochemical processes (efﬁciency of around 10%75) and water/steam electrolysis (efﬁciency exceeds 95%19).
The primary means of production of synthesis gas and H 2is catalytic reforming of hydrocarbons, especially of natural gas.
At present H 2from fossil fuels in general and natural gas in particular is by far cheaper than H 2from other sources. Amassive research effort in the technologies of harvesting the renewable energy as well as in the conversion technologies isnecessary in order to decrease the cost of ‘‘renewable’’ H 2.76 Synthetic CO 2neutral hydrocarbons have the potential of being competitors to ‘‘renewable’’ H 2, and therefore this option should also be carefully considered through serious research programs.
To justify that SOEC for H 2production is not only interesting from a scientiﬁc point of view but also have the potential forinexpensive commercial H 2production on large scale it is impor- tant to estimate H 2production prices using SOECs.
H2costs from high temperature electrolysis has been estimated to 1.1Vkg/C01–1.8Vkg/C0156,77–79(Using a current exchange rate of 1.46 $ ¼1V.) One of the recurring conclusions was that the expense of the electricity dominates the H 2cost and the electri- city price therefore signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the estimated H 2 production prices. The electricity cost in the estimations ranged from 0.014 Vper kWh to 0.037 Vper kWh.
The performance of a cell produced at Risø – DTU has been reported to be able to reach /C03.6 A cm/C02at only 1.48 V at 950/C14C,i.e.an ASR of the cell of approximately 0.17 Ucm2, and a 37% steam utilisation. Using this cell performance as aninput for the H 2production cost estimation, together with values in Table 1, the calculated H 2production cost as function of the electricity price is shown in Fig. 8. Note that the H 2production cost does not include storage costs. Before the economic forecast in Fig. 8 can be achieved it is necessary to produce cells with sufﬁcient performance stability. The initial performance isadequate, but the durability given in Table 1 is not yet met Table 1 Input for calculation of H 2production cost.32Reproduced by permission from Elsevier Investment cost 6300 US$/m2cell areaa Puriﬁed water cost 2.3 US$ m/C03 Depreciation time 10 years Operation time 5 yearsInterest rate 5%Energy loss in heatexchanger5% aA 5 kW plant based on SOFC technology is predicted to cost 350–550 Vper kW.81Assuming a power output of 1 W cm/C02this corresponds to an investment cost of 3500–5500 Vper m2cell area.

For comparison the price of H 2production from conventional low temperature alkaline electrolysis is shown as well.80The pie chart shows the production price parts given the assumptions in Table 1.

Downloaded by DTU Library on 28/07/2015 12:29:53.  View Article Online and the estimated H 2production prices therefore highly rely on electrode material development in order to produce long-termstable SOECs.
Comparing the higher heating values of H 2and oil, a price of 1Vkg/C01of H 2corresponds to an equivalent crude oil price of 30Vper barrel using ﬁgures from World Energy Council. The crude oil price of today is above 50 Vper barrel corresponding to an equivalent of 1.7 Vkg/C01of H 2. Then it follows from Fig. 8 that for electricity prices below 0.02–0.03 Vper kWh H 2 production by high temperature steam electrolysis can be competitive with H 2production from fossil fuels.
As an increasing part of the electricity production is to come from renewable energy sources it will become necessary to‘‘store’’ the electricity to balance inequalities in the consumer’s electricity demands and the electricity produced by the renewable energy sources. The solid oxide cells can work reversibly. Hence,the SOEC is an obvious choice for ‘‘Peak Shaving’’, i.e.where inexpensive electricity is used to produce H 2(to store the electri- city) and electricity can be produced from the H 2using SOFCs
(when electricity is expensive and the demand is high).56 5. Concluding remarks High temperature operation of water electrolysis signiﬁcantlyincreases the performance of both alkaline electrolysis cells(AEC) and solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC). Increasing theoperation temperature for AEC from the conventional 80–90
/C14C to above 200/C14C signiﬁcantly increases the electrolysis perfor- mance and thereby the electricity to H 2efﬁciency. An obstacle for operating at high temperature is the lower stability of thematerials. At present suitable cell and separator materials forHT-AEC, which are not more expensive than low temperaturealkaline electrolyser materials, have been identiﬁed, but the necessary long term stability remains to be proven.
For SOEC practical electricity to H 2efﬁciency of about 90% seems realistic and the initial performances reported for SOECsare promising with area speciﬁc resistances in electrolysis modedown to 0.17 Ucm 2at 950/C14C for a full SOC. Also for SOEC the lifetime is the main issue to be addressed before the techno-logy is commercially viable. The main problem for state-of-the-art SOECs relates to the degradation of the Ni/YSZ based H 2 electrode and it is necessary either to grossly improve the state-of-the-art Ni/YSZ electrode for electrolysis operation or develophighly performing and long-term stable H 2electrodes based on alternative materials.
At electricity prices below 0.02–0.03 Vper kWh H 2production by high temperature steam electrolysis using SOECs is competi-tive to production from fossil fuels. Because the electrolysis cellscan work reversibly, production of H 2viaelectrolysis in periods with low electricity prices, and reverse in periods with highelectricity prices (as is often the case for electricity productionfrom renewable energy sources) is an obvious choice for ‘‘PeakShaving’’.
From a materials point of view a substantial fundamental R&D effort is necessary to develop inexpensive, highly perform-ing and long-term stable electrolysis cells. In the long-term more technologically related development is necessary to produce efﬁcient and cost competitive SOEC systems for large scale H 2 production e.g.in systems with renewable energy sources.6.
